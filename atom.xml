    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So far, I&#39;m very impressed with the Octopress docs. They are clear and (at the time of this writing) they work as advertised. Following the steps on these pages worked for me.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://octopress.org/docs/setup/">Initial Setup</a></li>
<li><a href="http://octopress.org/docs/configuring/">Configuring Octopress</a></li>
<li><a href="http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/">Deploying</a></li>
</ol>

<p>There was one small hiccup on my first attempt, which was probably my own fault. Somehow, I configured it to generate the site into the directory <code>source/afred/</code> instead of just <code>source/</code>. The result of this was when I published to Github user pages, none of the styles or javascript loaded, because the <code>afred</code> directory was in the path. E.g. it was trying to load <code>/afred/stylesheets/screen.css</code>, which existed on my local machine, but on github, that file is at <code>/stylesheets/screen.css</code>.</p>

<p>I found that in <code>config.rb</code> the lines:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">  <span class="c1"># Publishing paths</span>
  <span class="n">http_path</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/afred&quot;</span>
  <span class="n">http_images_path</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/afred/images&quot;</span>
  <span class="n">http_generated_images_path</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/afred/images&quot;</span>
  <span class="n">http_fonts_path</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;afred/fonts&quot;</span>
  <span class="n">css_dir</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;public/afred/stylesheets&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This turned out to be the issue. I removed the <code>afred</code> part of these paths, re-deployed, and the assets loaded.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">  <span class="c1"># Publishing paths</span>
  <span class="n">http_path</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/&quot;</span>
  <span class="n">http_images_path</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/images&quot;</span>
  <span class="n">http_generated_images_path</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/images&quot;</span>
  <span class="n">http_fonts_path</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/fonts&quot;</span>
  <span class="n">css_dir</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;public/stylesheets&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now.. I&#39;m still not sure how it got to be that way in the first place. In an effort to find out, I removed my Github repo and started over from scratch. But the 2nd time, I must have followed the directions better, because I didn&#39;t have the same issue. Go figure.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m pleased with Octopress so far. I am not a blogger at all, so we&#39;ll see how well I stick to making posts. Actually, the real reason for trying it out now is that I&#39;m looking for a drop-in blog solution for Rails apps. I had the idea that if Octopress could be mounted as an Rails engine, and if I could find a Markdown editor for the front end, then it might be a good solution into which we could integrate functionality from the containing Rails app via Octopress plugins. Not sure how well that would work. But playing with Octopress is step one.</p>
